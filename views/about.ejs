            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
                Hi, I’m ERMFox, a passionate game designer, worldbuilder, and backend developer.
                I love creating immersive experiences through storytelling, art, and interactive gameplay.

        <!-- Background and Journey -->
<section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
    <p>
        My journey started with a fascination for the stories and worlds within my favorite games. Over time, that passion
        turned into worldbuilding, writing, and eventually game development. I’m currently finishing my apprenticeship in software
        development and preparing to start my BMS (Berufsmaturität), with the goal of studying game design at ZHdK.
        Along the way, I’ve explored backend development, storytelling, art, and game systems to build a foundation
        for the kind of immersive, meaningful games I want to create.

        <!-- Values and Motivation -->

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>
                My goal as a creator is to bring joy, hope, and meaning through interactive experiences. Games were a big
                part of why I found hope during tough times, and I want to give back by creating worlds where players 
                can find their own solace and excitement.

<!-- Goals and Aspirations -->

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I’m currently building my portfolio and finishing my apprenticeship while preparing for BMS. My next major goal is to study game design at ZHdK,
        where I can grow as both a developer and a creative thinker. Long-term, I aspire to work in the game industry as a narrative designer or concept artist,
        combining storytelling, technical skills, and worldbuilding into projects that resonate with players.
