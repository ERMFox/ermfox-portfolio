            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m ERMFox, a passionate game designer, worldbuilder, and backend developer.
                I love creating immersive experiences through storytelling, art, and interactive gameplay.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in game design started with a deep love for storytelling and the worlds within my favorite games.
                As I explored game mechanics and development, I realized I wanted to bring my own worlds to life and share 
                them with others. Now, I’m working toward a game design degree while freelancing as a backend developer,
                building my skills in both creative and technical areas.
            </p>

            <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>
                My goal as a creator is to bring joy, hope, and meaning through interactive experiences. Games were a big
                part of why I found hope during tough times, and I want to give back by creating worlds where players 
                can find their own solace and excitement.

                In the short term, I’m focused on building my portfolio, gaining freelance experience, and completing my
                game design degree. Long-term, I aspire to work as a concept artist or narrative designer in the game industry
